# Other


These are other topics that may be covered in varying detail in the future. With possible packages noted. 

- Collaborative filtering
    - recommenderlab
- Other Mixture models (additional to what is already there) 
    - Discuss zero-inflated models, and possibly add other content.
- HMM, Linear Dynamical Systems
    - HMM, HiddenMarkov depmixS4
- Others


Extensions to current content that might be added in the future:

- To SEM chapter: regression with latent variable scores comparison
- To Growth chapter: why not to do cross-lagged models. (vs. bn, quickly unweildy (3 time points = potentially 19 parameters with no covariates in the model), is 'stability' actually a key question? suggests scale is unreliable)
